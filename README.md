# Tesseract OCT + Scanner Handling (Momentarily for Scanshell 800r)

A simple windows forms app to help with the process of scanning a romanian ID document and extracting the text from the MRZ lines
= Processing the image to prepare it for OCR
= Then detecting the text with Tesseract OCR 
= Extracting the text to a txt file
= Parsing the text to get the necessary information , while using some mapping for some codes

= Also created a minimal api on localhost , if needed for testing, just run the app and navigate to localhost:PORT/scan_id while having the ID prepared in the physical scanner

--- Not yet completed , no edge cases handles
